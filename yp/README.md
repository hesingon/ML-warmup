Things to do:
Hyperparameters to tune:
1. number of layers
2. number of perceptrons in each layer
3. window_size
4. sample rate
5. type of solver
6. number of iterations

If you look at the confusion matrix, you will notice the following moves are always mixed up:
Frontback and sidestep
Turnclap is sometimes mistaken as squat
Window is almost always misclassified as window360

These 3 sources contribute a lot to the low accuracy

We should collect better data
